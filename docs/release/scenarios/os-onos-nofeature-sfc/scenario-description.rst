Introduction
============

ONOSFW addresses integrating an SDN controller of choice based on a target applications or use cases within the OPNFV defined NFVI and VIM framework.
In the Colorado release, in addition to the features in the Brahmaputra release, ONOSFW has included more functions in the Goldeneys of ONOS, \
and added service Function Chaining scenario by integrating the networking-sfc capability of openstack.
Therefore, both features and scenarios configurations are described.
